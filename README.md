<h2> Portfolio</h2>
This portfolio showcases projects across different domains and my skills of utilizing PowerBI, SQL, Python and Tableau to get insights from data by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to generate visualizations.
<br><br>
All files are kept inside their <strong>respective folders</strong>. 
<br><br>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong> - contains ipynb (jupyter notebook) files for different projects. The code can be viewed directly by clicking on the file here in GitHub. Alternatively, the files can be downloaded as well.</li>
  <li><strong>PowerBI</strong> - contains pdf files of the PowerBI Reports and Dashboards.</li>
  <li><strong>Tableau</strong> - <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aman.devrath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portfolio Link</a>. Since Tableau Public allows users to publish dashboards for the world to see, I have attached the link.
  <li><strong>SQL</strong> - contains SQL files that shows all the SQL queries for the project.</li>
</ul>
